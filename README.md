# TD Canada Trust Bank transaction Scraper

This CasperJS-based script automates the process of downloading TD Canada Trust transaction history.

### Is this a good idea?
No. I am by no means a security expert. You probably shouldn't use this.

### Should you use this script?
No. Even if you have read over every line to make sure that it is not malicious, it's still probably a bad idea.

### How to use

1. Run `yarn install`
1. Customize `config.js` with your account details
1. Run `yarn start`

### Note
If this is the first time logging into the bank's website from your computer, it may ask additional security questions. This script does not handle these cases, so please login  using a web browser first before running the script.
